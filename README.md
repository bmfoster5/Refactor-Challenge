# <Refactor Challenge>

## Description

In this challenge, I want to refactor Horizon Social Solution Servicesâ€™s source code so that it may be more accessible to people with disabilities by implementing a nav and alt attributes. 

- My motivation for this project was to help people with impaired eyesight to understand the photos and text of the provided website. 
- The added and re-organized code solved issues with recognizing semantic HTML elements and attributes. In addition, also provided text displaying what the photos represented on the webpage. 
- I learned that by adding semantic HTML elements, re-organizing the code, adding a navigation bar, the website became more accesible to not only the visualy impaired, but for coders like myself who want to read "cleaner" code.
